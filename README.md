# bsticker
Shows how to use BrightSign's super-smooth Javascript ticker.

You can use it in three ways: 

- As an AngularJS custom tag, namely <ticker>. See index.html for an example. If you deploy all the files in this project to a
BrightSign player, this is the type of ticker you will see.
- As an AngularJS service. See how the custom tag is implemented in components.js for how to use it.
- As a standalone Javascript object. See how the service is implemented in services.js for how to use it.
